## Our Company
YAKA Games is a young crypto **Game Publisher** working on multiplatform IA empowered games and augmented reality experiences. 

We are a growing indie, creative, fun-loving professionals, united in their passion for Games & Design. 
We believe that if you want to go far, go together.

It takes a diverse team of people sharing a common vision to make a groundbreaking game. 
Mutual trust, a shared purpose, and the determination to overcome any obstacles together defines what it means to have a great team. We also believe that fun games can only come from teams that have fun!

We take our work seriously, but not ourselves.

As a **crypto company**, Yaka Games don't really exist (yet). 
We are - like Contoso - a **fictional company** used to demonstrate the Publisher work.

## Our Mission
> We want to make the best games possible, and we believe that making them should be fun

## Our Philosophy
At YAKA Games, we want to be the best in the world at whatever we do, so we never compromise on quality. But we also believe that making games should be fun, and we do everything we can to create an environment which fosters creativity, teamwork and a relaxed working atmosphere. Everyone in the team is able to give feedback on life at YAKA, and improvements are frequently made to studio tools and processes based on the results of our regular Staff Satisfaction surveys.

Our company values are at the core of everything we do and they define how we interact with each other, customers and partners on a daily basis. They guide our business, our product development, and our brand.

As our company continues to evolve and grow, these values remind us of who we are, where we came from and where we are going.
